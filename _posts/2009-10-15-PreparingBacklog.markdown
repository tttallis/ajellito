1. Add user stories to backlog quickly by filling out a short form. 

2. Stories are sorted by priority (lowest rank number to highest).

3. Add tasks, edit or delete stories.


1. Each user story has a name and optional description.

2. Prioritize the story by numbered rank, lower number means higher priority. Stories can have the same priority.
