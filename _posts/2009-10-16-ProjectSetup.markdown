## Add Users

It is useful, before adding the project to add the users that will
be working with the system. I suppose that you have administrator
permissions and that you already logged in the system.

The steps to add a user are the following, from the main admin
window:

-   Click on "User", this will display a list of users and at the
    top right of the screen you should see (in gray) the "Add user"
    button. Or click the "add" button next to "User" which takes you
    directly to step 3.
-   Click "Add user", this will show the add user form.
-   Fill the form with the desired data.
-   Click on "Save and add another" if you need to add another
    user, or click on "Save" when you are done.

### Additional User Permissions

Some times a user may need to login the user the admin site for
different reason, or you may want the user to have different types
of permissions. So I'm going to show you a way to edit the users:

-   Click on "Users", this will display a the list of users in the
    site.
-   Click on the username of the user which you wan to edit, this
    will display the form to edit that user.
-   If you want to edit the password, click on "Change password
    form", DO NOT EDIT password field directly.
-   If you want the user to be able to use the admin site check the
    "Staff status" box.
-   If you want the user to be admin check the "Superuser status"
    box.

-   Adding permissions is very similar to adding a user to a
    project, slide the permissions you need to the other list using the
    arrows.
-   When finished click on save.

-   Click on "home" (top left, below the title) to return to the
    main admin screen.

## Add Project(s)

Adding a project is very similar to adding a user:

-   Click on "Project", this will display the list of projects and
    at the top right of the screen "Add project" button. Or click the
    "add" button next to "Project" which takes you directly to step 3.
-   Click "Add project", this will display the add project form.

-   Fill the form. Add users to you projects by selecting from the
    list on the left and moving them to the list on the right by
    clicking on the arrow which points to the right.
-   Click on "Save", or click on "Save and add another" if you want
    to add more projects.
-   Go back to the main admin page, by clicking "home" (top left of
    the screen)

## Add Iteration(s)

Also very similar for the iteration:

-   Click on "Iteration", this will display a list of iterations,
    and the "Add iteration" button. Here also you can click on the
    "add" button next to "Iteration" and will take you directly to step
    3.
-   Click on "Add iteration", this will show the add user form

-   Fill the form. You may leave release blank, but not project.
    You can pick the project from the drop down, or if you want you can
    create it, using the plus button, which will display in a separate
    window the add project form. You can also do the same for release.
-   Click on "Save", or click on "Save and add another" depending
    on what you want to do next.
-   Go back to the main admin page, by clicking "home" (top left of
    the screen).
