Login to Agilito with your account. In the top left area of the screen, under the search box, there is a dropdown list of the available projects. Choose the project for which you want to estimate.

Search the User Story you will be estimating. At the start of an iteration it should be in the Backlog (not yet assigned to an iteration), or in the iteration you're working on.

Click on the US link to show the description and tasks. Below "Related to USxx" there is the list of the tasks and a "add a task" link. Click on that link.

You will be presented with a new screen. Add the following info:

* Name: a descriptive name of the task
* Description: a summary of the task, what will be worked and needs, etc.
* Estimate: the total time in hours that you estimate will spend working on the task.
* Remaining: if the task is new, it should be the same amount you entered in "Estimate".
* State: unless you are jumping straight to work on the task, you should leave it as "Defined"; else, mark it as "In progress".
* Owner: select your username from the dropdown list.


Click "Save". You're done.
